The test scripts and jpfscripts found here are intended for use with
the Java Pathfinder (JPF) model testing and analysis package.

The directory jpfscripts contains the script files that are
provided to JPF that configure JPF for the analysis performed.

The testscript directory contains the LINUX shell script files that
launch the fault exposing test class on the desired Java library.

Each testscript utilizes the testscript/jacontebe.sh script
which contains functions to check the environment and set
environment variables.  These scripts also condition the
runtime environment to allow JPF to find the libraries and
class files necessary to run each test.
