    - install.sh
   
    - runJPF.sh

1. install.sh <application directory> <application name>

   <application directory> : orig
   
   <application name> : the name of the application about to run  

   Example:

   %install.sh orig dbcp1


   Tasks done by this script:

       - Removes all previous files in ~/source directory

       - Removes all previous files in ~/outputs directory

       - Copies Java source files to ~/source directory

       - Compiles the Java source files

2. runJPF.sh <application directory> <application name> <search type> <number of runs> <show log switch>

   <application directory> : orig
   
   <application name> : the name of the application about to test
   
   <search type> : default or random

   <number of runs> : (optional - ignored unless a random search order
                      is specified) the number of times JPF is invoked;
                      default is 1
   <show log switch> : -v

   Example:

   %runJPF.sh orig dbcp1 random 10 -v

   Tasks done by this script:

       - Runs the Java PathFinder model checker on the dbcp1 code in the 'orig'
         directory structure 10 times using the random search order
       - Generates a new seed for each run of JPF. 
       - Names the resulting log file using the generated seed.
       - Turn on "-log -show" switch for JPF

   Example:

   %runJPF.sh orig dbcp1 default

   Tasks done by this script:

       - Runs the Java PathFinder model checker on the dbcp1 code in the 'orig'
         directory structure using the default search order
