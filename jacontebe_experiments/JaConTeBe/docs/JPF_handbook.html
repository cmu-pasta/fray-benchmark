<h2>SIR Objects JPF Handbook</h2>
<p>
Java Pathfinder (JPF) is an extensible tool set providing model checking and defect detection
of Java bytecode artifacts.  JPF, when used as a program verifier platform is capable of:
<ol>
<li>finding and explaining defects</li>
<li>collecting "deep" runtime information like coverage metrics</li>
<li>deducing interesting test vectors and create corresponding test drivers.</li>
</ol>
This list is far from inclusive of all the capabilites that JPF provides however.
</p>
<p>
Using JPF on the concurrency subjects provided by the SIR
can reveal the deficiencies manifested by these implementations.
JPF enables the revelation of these faults by searching the state space of for all combinations
and then optimizes this search in several ways to minimize the time required to cover
the state space.
</p>
<p>
The SIR concurrency subjects provide a basic JPF analysis script including a predetermined
configuration of JPF properties with each subject.  Users can choose to use this script, or to
generate their own JPF properties configurations and include different JPF plugins in there
experimentation.
</p>
<p>
JPF evolves fast, different versions of JPF may need different configurations. This
handbook is written and tested based on JPF 1202.
</p>

****************************1. Before running JPF****************************
-->
<h3>JPF Run Preparation</h3>
<p>
In order to run JPF, make sure the target you would like to run has already been properly installed and compiled
using the <code>${experiment_root}/SUBJECT_NAME/scripts/install.sh</code>, and the compiled classes and necessary files
are installed into the <code>${experiment_root}/SUBJECT_NAME/source</code> directory.  The SIR concurrency subjects
provide the original version of the subject which manifests one or more concurrency
deficiencies. In some SIR concurrency subjects, a fixed version which has been modified to eliminate the cause
of the deficiency is also provided.  Specifying which version you desire to install is necessary when you execute the
install script.  To determine which versions a particular concurrency subject provides examine the
<code>SUBJECT_NAME/versions.alt</code> directory and any subdirectories therein.
</p>
<p>
For example, to compile target JaConTeBe subject's tests for log4j1:
<div>
<code>
${experiment_root}/JaConTeBe/scripts/install.sh orig log4j1
</code>
</div>
</p>
<p>
This copies and builds the <em>orig</em> version of the source code, which is stored
under the <code>${experiment_root}/JaConTeBe/versions.alt/orig</code> directory
into the <code>${experiment_root}/JaConTeBe/source</code> directory.
After running this command, the <em>orig</em> version of the <em>log4j1</em> object,
which is provided as part of the <em>JaConTeBe</em> SIR subject, is ready for experimentation.
</p>
<h3>JPF Runtime Considerations</h3>
<p>
Once installed, the object is now ready to have JPF executed.
The runJPF.sh script provided is intended to execute JPF on
the SIR concurrency object.  For SIR subjects that encapsulate more than one
concurrency subject, e.g. JaConTeBe, the JaConTeBe/testplans.alt/jpfscripts
directory contains properties files that configure JPF for one or more
of the concurrency objects within the SIR object package.
</p> 
<!-- ****************************2. Prepare JPF configuration file**************************** -->
<h3>JPF Configuration Files</h3>
<p>
JPF typically is used with a properties file to set the parameters of behavior.  The parameters
of JPF are an ever expanding set due to the continued use and enhancement being done by
both NASA and other researchers.  For the subjects maintained in the SIR,
we use a single JPF launcher script file, <em>runJPF.sh</em>, to start each JPF run.
Some subjects provide object specific parameters on the JPF command line within the
<em>runJPF.sh</em> script while others may require users to supply their own parameters
configuration file.  Further detailed information on JPF configuration files can be found
on the <a href="http://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/trac/jpf/wiki/user/config" target="_blank">JPF WIKI page</a>
on configuration.
</p>
<p>
Other subjects in the SIR may provide one or more
JPF configuration files.  These files are located in the ${expriment_root}/SUBJECT_NAME/testplan.alt/jpfscripts
directory and are named as <target>.jpf, where <target> is one of the <i>orig</i> or <i>fixed</i>
versions.
</p>
<p>
For example, a simple test log4j1's JPF configuration file
would be located in ${expriment_root}/JaConTeBe/testplan.alt/jpfscripts/log4j1.jpf,
and its contents contain:

<div>
<pre>
target = Test44032
classpath =./source:./lib/javaee-api-5.jar:./versions.alt/lib/realLib/coring-1.4.jar:./versions.alt/lib/realLib/jacontebe-1.0.jar
target.args = -tn,2,-l,1
</pre>
</div>

Each test may require different target.args values to run the experiment.
Also note that the paths specified are relative paths, thus
this script expects to ultimately be executed from the ${experiment_root}/JaConTeBe directory.
</p>
<p>
Not all concurrency subjects will function within JPF due to unimplemented
native functions and other limitations imposed by the JPF framework.  Typical
errors presented by JPF in these instances will reflect a failure to find one
or more classes that are normally part of the standard JVM.  The object description
for <a href="http://sir.unl.edu/portal/bios/JaConTeBe.php">JaConTeBe</a> provides a listing of the
objects provided along with the associated JPF failure or error detected by
the authors.
For more advanced settings and usage tips refer to JPF's online manual,

</p>
<h3>Running JPF Analyses</h3>
<p>
Many of the SIR concurrency objects provide a shell script that executes JPF analysis on the object.
For the JaConTeBe subject the
<code>${experiment_root}/JaConTeBe/scripts/runJPF.sh</code> script is the JPF launcher for
all JPF runs. A minimum of 2 command-line arguments are necessary to perform a JPF analysis.
<div>
<code>
runJPF.sh target-test search-type [number-of-iterations] [-v] 
</code>
<ul>
<li>first argument: target test's name.</li>
<li>second argument: JPF search algorithm type: <b>default</b> or <b>random</b></li>
<li>third argument: desired JPF run iterations (optional): number of times JPF is invoked
while performing <em>random</em> search iterations</li>
<li>fourth argument: -v (optional): display verbose output, sets the <em>-log -show</em> debugging
flags on the JPF command line</li>
</ul>
</div>
</p>
<p>
For example, to run the default JPF analysis on the log4j1 library, provided
as part of the JaConTeBe subject, the command line would be:
</p>
<p>
<code>
${experiment_root}/JaConTeBe/scripts/runJPF.sh log4j1 default
</code>
</p>
<p>
The JPF output result would be:

<p>
The output above represents one of the analyses that JPF is capable of, and as expected
the concurrency bug is not exposed in every execution.  The choices of JPF
analyses depends upon the JPF components installed.
</p>
<p>
While JPF is not limited to use on the concurrency subjects, it has not been used with
the other (non-concurrency) testing research subjects by the SIR staff.
Thus, we have no experience with
using JPF with these subjects and we suggest following the JPF users guide if you intend
to experiment with JPF and these subjects.
